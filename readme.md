Short text about myself.
I am Martin Pagels. I'm from Hamburg, Germany and currently working as a web developer / assistent coach at neuefische.
I had always a fable for computers and the drive to learn new software. In the end of 2018 I got a raspberry pi and since then I fall in love with programming and changed my profession to pursue my dream to create awesome applications that help people.
Check out my github so see my journey from programming enthusiast to progammer lover.
